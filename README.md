# Crating-calculator

The objective of this calculator is to produce the correct size of crate 
after number of boxes are entered. 
After entering number of boxes, followed by the terms "new", "old", or 
"not boxed", the calculator should return the full dimensions of the crate, 
along with other values such as amount of materials used, approximate weight, etc.
